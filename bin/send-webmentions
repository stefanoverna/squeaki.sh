# Webmentions are a standard for notifying websites when you link to them.
# This script reads the RSS feed and sends notifications for new links.
#
# Options:
# --limit 1: Only process one new mention per run (prevents flooding)
# --send: Actually send the webmentions (without this flag, it runs in dry-run mode)

set -e  # Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status

# Send webmentions from the RSS feed
webmention dist/rss.xml --limit 1 --send
